# EV Charging Mobile Application (React Native)

## Introduction

The EV Charging Mobile Application is designed to enhance the user experience and management of CCS (Combined Charging System) chargers for electric vehicles. Our goal is to provide a seamless and efficient solution for both EV owners and charging station operators, enabling convenient access to CCS chargers and efficient management of charging sessions. Whether you're a driver in need of a charge or an operator looking to streamline your charging station's performance, our application is tailored to meet your CCS charging needs.

## Running React Native using Expo

To run the EV Charging Mobile Application using Expo, follow these steps:

1. Install Expo globally on your system if you haven't already:

   ```
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CameronBlack19/EVCharging.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd EVCharging
   ```

4. Install the project dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```
   expo start
   ```

6. Use the Expo client app on your iOS or Android device to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or on the web page that opens. This will allow you to view and test the application on your device.
